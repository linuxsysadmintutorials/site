disqus_title: Create a Maildir directory and its sub directories

In order for maildir to work properly, the Maildir directories in each users home directory needs to be setup properly.

Create ~/Maildir using mu.

```
$ mu mkdir ~/Maildir
```

Don't have the mu binary? It is usually found in the maildir-utils Ubuntu package.
